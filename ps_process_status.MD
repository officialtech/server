#### The `ps aux` command is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux) to display information about active processes. Here's what each part of the command does:

- `ps`: This command stands for "process status" and is used to view information about processes.
- `aux`: These are options or flags passed to the `ps` command to specify the output format and the list of processes to display.
  - `a`: This option tells `ps` to list the processes of all users on the system, rather than just those of the current user.
  - `u`: This option displays detailed information about each process, including the user who owns the process, the CPU and memory usage, the start time, and more.
  - `x`: This option includes in the output processes that do not have a controlling terminal, typically processes that are not attached to a terminal window (such as background processes).

When you run `ps aux` in the terminal, it will display a list of all processes currently running on the system, along with detailed information about each process. This information can be useful for monitoring system activity, troubleshooting performance issues, and managing processes.


> Example: Identify the PID of the Gunicorn process running for the other project.
```
ps aux | grep gunicorn
```
